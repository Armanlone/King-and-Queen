# King & Queen

# About:
 A puzzling love story of a King and a Queen unable to reach each other.

Help them by solving different kinds of puzzles in every level, and unlocking their ending.

This is a heartwarming game to show what's pure love and wholesomeness for the children.

A combination of Date Night by Brackeys and Heart Star by Adventure Islands.
    
# Codes:
 The codes are using the "UnityEvents" of Unity, combined with the "Single-Responsibility" principle of SOLID and the "Singleton Pattern" used in the previous game.
